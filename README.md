# Real-Time-Facemask-Detection-with-Alarm-System
This project had 2 modules. The first module was a face mask detection module which accepted an image of a 
personâ€™s face which was captured by a camera and detected if that person was wearing a mask or not. The 
second module set off an alarm based on the outcome of the detection. I was responsible for design and 
development of Real time face mask detection module
